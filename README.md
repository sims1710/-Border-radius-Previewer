# Border-radius Previewer
**Description:**
This web application allows users to visualize and customize the border-radius property of a box in real-time. Users can adjust the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners of the box independently using range input sliders. Additionally, the tool includes a color picker for changing the background color of the box, and users can copy the generated CSS code to the clipboard.

**Usage:**
1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. The web application consists of a header section, a box section with sliders, a color picker, and a "Copy CSS" button.
3. Adjust the sliders labeled "Top Left," "Top Right," "Bottom Left," and "Bottom Right" to modify the corresponding corners of the box. The changes are reflected in real-time in the preview box.
4. Click on the box to change its background color randomly or use the color picker to select a specific color.
5. Click the "Copy CSS" button to copy the generated CSS code for the border-radius and background color to the clipboard.

**Libraries:**
The code utilizes standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without additional external libraries. 

**Note:** All the files must be in the same directory before running the HTML page.

**Roadmap:**

Even though the app is developed, there is room for improvement. Re-creating it using React.js or implementation of advanced CSS are possible implementations to pursue.

**Project Status:**

Currently, the application is complete!
